History[edit]
As early as 1989, Allentown city officials had announced plans to revitalize an old industrial area, which included the abandoned Arbogast & Bastian meat packing plant, along the Lehigh River.[1]  This redevelopment, which was to be known as "Lehigh Landing," was to include a museum, a brewery, walking trails, a footbridge across the river, and a promenade for festivals.[1]  Development was hindered by fundraising problems, environmental remediation issues, and even a national debate on pork barrel government spending.[1]  After three separate groundbreakings (2001, 2004 and 2005), the museum, which cost over $17 million to build, was officially opened to the public on April 12, 2008.[1]

Collection and exhibits[edit]
1889 Nadig Gas-Powered Carriage[edit]
A historically important part of the museum's collection is the 1889 Nadig Gas-Powered Carriage, one of the first gas-powered vehicles driven in America.[4]  Henry Nadig, a German-born mechanic living in Allentown, built his gas-powered carriage in 1889, two years before Charles E. Duryea's first gas-powered automobile.  Police forced him to drive the carriage at night, because during the day it scared horses.[4]  The vehicle was discovered rusting in a collapsed shed in Allentown, and restored.[4]

General collection[edit]
The collection of the America on Wheels is minimal as the majority of the vehicles on display are on loan.  The West Gallery changes every six months based on a new theme.  A number of the vehicles are on loan from the Mack Truck Museum of Allentown PA.
