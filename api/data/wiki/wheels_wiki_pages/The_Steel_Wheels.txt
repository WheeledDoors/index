Biography[edit]
Songwriter and lead singer Trent Wagler conceived of a project entitled Distance Together, an avenue for fans of the band to commission works and send musical greetings to their loved ones. The initiative sparked a songwriting process, with Wagler setting the personal stories of fans to song and verse.[citation needed] The project has been documented in an accompanying podcast, We Made You a Song, on NPR. Each episode dives into the creation of a single song on the album, serving as an in-depth audio liner note. Wagler interviews the band as well as the actual subjects of each song to give a look into the creative process and what it means for someone to have their experience distilled into melody and rhyme. 
The Steel Wheel release albums under their own label, Big Ring Records. During the first few months of the pandemic and cessation of all touring, The Steel Wheels recorded over 120 songs in their isolated studios.[citation needed]
Trent Wagler is lead vocalist, mountain banjo player, guitarist and the band's primary songwriter. Jay Lapp plays mandolin, guitar, electric guitar and sings. Eric Brubaker plays fiddle and sings. Kevin Joaquin Garcia plays drums, hand percussion and keyboards. Former member Brian Dickel plays Bass and sings. Brian has accepted ownership of Huss & Dalton Guitars and has since amicably left the band. Derek Kratzer will join The Steel Wheels on stage and in the studio starting September of 2021.[1]

Red Wing Roots Music Festival[edit]
Since 2012, the group has hosted the Red Wing Roots Music Festival at Natural Chimneys Park in Mt. Solon, Virginia.[2]

Musical style[edit]
The Steel Wheels perform an exciting and original take on folk, folk rock and Appalachian roots music with a modern twist. Their records and performances are dynamic and varied from beautiful heartbreaking songs to wild instrumental frenzy.[citation needed]

Honors, awards, and distinctions[edit]
The Steel Wheels received seven nominations from The Independent Music Awards[3] in 2010. Their song "Nothing You Can't Lose" (from the album Red Wing) received the award of "Best Country Song" in the 10th Annual IMA Awards and in the Vox Pop Awards. "Working on a Building" won "Best Gospel Song" in the 10th Annual IMA Vox Pop Awards. Red Wing earned very high marks from critics and received airplay on radio stations across several markets.[citation needed] The album charted for 13 weeks on the Americana Music Association Top 40 radio charts, hitting No. 15.[4] It also made its way onto the EuroAmericana[5] charts, finding its way into the top 10. It was ranked number two across all independent releases charted by the Americana Music Association, and number 70 on the top 100 Americana albums of 2010.[4]

Their "Rain in the Valley" was chosen as NPR's Song of the Day for May 10, 2012.[6]
The group appeared opening day at the Stagecoach Festival 2013 in Indio, California.[7]
