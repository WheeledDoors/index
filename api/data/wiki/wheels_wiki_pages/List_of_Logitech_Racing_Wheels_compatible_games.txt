Yes* : works without H-pattern shifter.
Note : G25 has a sequential gear shift option that makes it more compatible so this chart is inaccurate for the G27 which does not have that feature. Both G25 and G27 have H-pattern shifter, but only the G25 allows for sequential shift.
Note : G29 has new software and a lot of games do not support this wheel or is partly compatible.
Note : Only G29 works with PS4, other wheels needs additional adapters.
Note : MOMO Racing was advertised as a PC wheel and it isn't compatible with some games on PS2. eg. PS2 era Gran Turismo series and Initial D: Special Stage don't recognize the wheel when plugged in.
