Conventional door[edit]
A conventional door, also known as a regular door or vehicle door is a type of door that is hinged at the front-facing edge of the door, and so allows the door to swing outward from the hull of the bus. These doors are relatively safe, in that if they are opened during forward motion of the vehicle, the wind resistance will work against the opening door, and will effectively force its closure.

Folding doors[edit]
A folding door can have an electric folding door mechanism or manually operated. It is widely used on some older model city buses, mini-buses and school buses that have no air sources.
Its features a whole frame design which can give it superior performance and excellent durability.
It can be used in extremely hot and cold climates.
