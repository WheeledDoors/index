History[edit]
In the fall of 2012, Stanford University students Tony Xu, Stanley Tang, Andy Fang and Evan Moore (now a partner at Khosla Ventures)[10] were getting feedback on a mobile app for small business owners when a macaroon store owner told them of her challenges meeting demand for deliveries.[11]
In January 2013, they launched PaloAltoDelivery.com in Palo Alto, California.[12] In the summer of 2013, it received $120,000 in seed money from Y Combinator in exchange for a 7% stake. It incorporated as DoorDash in June 2013.[13][14]
In December 2018, DoorDash overtook Uber Eats to hold the second position in total US food delivery sales, behind GrubHub.[15] By March 2019, it had exceeded GrubHub in total sales, at 27.6% of the on-demand delivery market.[16] By early 2019, DoorDash was the largest food delivery provider in the U.S., as measured by consumer spending.[17] It maintained that market position in 2019.[18]
In October 2019, DoorDash opened its first ghost kitchen, DoorDash Kitchen, in Redwood City, California, with four restaurants operating at the location.[19]
In January 2020, it was reported that DoorDash had lied about skimming tips from its drivers, causing them to earn an average of $1.45 an hour after expenses, and that after the company had allegedly overhauled its tipping system, DoorDash was still manipulating per-delivery payouts at the expense of drivers.[20][21][22][23]
By June 2020, DoorDash had raised more than $2.5 billion over several financing rounds from investors including Y Combinator, Charles River Ventures, SV Angel, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, SoftBank Group,[24] GIC,[25] and Kleiner Perkins.[26]
In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DoorDash announced it had "stockpiled tens of thousands of gloves and bottles of hand sanitizer" and was offering them to delivery drivers for free. The company also said it had changed the default drop-off option to contactless delivery.[27] That month, DoorDash became the fastest growing food delivery service.[28]
In October 2020, the company launched its "Reopen for Delivery" program to have brick-and-mortar restaurants that have closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic partner with local ghost kitchen operators to offer food delivery- and pick-up-only service.[29]
In November 2020, DoorDash announced the opening of its first physical restaurant location, partnering up with Bay Area restaurant Burma Bites to offer delivery and pick-up orders.[30][31]
On December 9, 2020, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $3.37 billion.[32][5][33] The price has seesawed from initial opening of $182[32] to a low of $112 in May 2021, a high of $257 in November 2021, to a new low of $74 in March 2022.[34]
In February 2021, 55% of DoorDash's drivers were women.[35]
In May 2021, DoorDash was criticized for unauthorized listings of restaurants who had not given permission to appear on the app.[36] The company was sued by Lona's Lil Eats in St. Louis, with the lawsuit claiming that DoorDash had listed them without permission, then prevented any orders to the restaurant from going through and redirecting customers to other restaurants instead, because Lona's was "too far away," when in reality it had not paid DoorDash a fee for listing.[37] This aspect of DoorDash's business practice is illegal in California.[37]

Markets[edit]
DoorDash began expanding into international markets in 2015, launching in Toronto, Canada.[38] The company started operating in markets outside North America in 2019, officially launching in Melbourne, Australia, in September and later expanding further into the country.[39][40] In 2021, the company expanded its service area again, launching services in Sendai, Japan in June[41] and Stuttgart, Germany in November.[42]
The company expanded its service offerings in 2020, adding grocery delivery initially in California and the Midwest in August 2020.[43] DoorDash expanded the service offerings in 2021 to include DoubleDash, which allows for orders from multiple merchants, and alcohol delivery in 20 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Canada, and Australia.[44][45]

Acquisitions[edit]
Caviar – In October 2019, DoorDash acquired Caviar, a service specializing in food delivery from upscale urban-area restaurants that typically do not offer delivery, from Square, Inc. for $410 million.[46][47][48]
Scotty Labs – In August 2019, the company acquired Scotty Labs, a tele-operations startup company that focuses on self-driving and remote-controlled vehicle technology.[49][50]
Chowbotics – On February 8, 2021, DoorDash announced its acquisition of Chowbotics, a robotics company known for its salad-making robot.[51][52][53] The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal, but Chowbotics was valued at $46 million in 2018.[54]
Wolt - On November 9, 2021, DoorDash announced its acquisition of Wolt for over $8.1 billion[55]
Controversies, lawsuits, and criticism[edit]

Withholding of tips[edit]
In July 2019, the company's tipping policy was criticized by The New York Times, and later The Verge and Vox and Gothamist.[6][56][57][58] Drivers receive a guaranteed minimum per order, which is paid by DoorDash by default. When a customer added a tip, instead of going directly to the driver, it first went to the company to cover the guaranteed minimum. Drivers then only directly received the part of the tip that exceeded the minimum. A DoorDash customer filed a class action lawsuit against the company for its "materially false and misleading" tipping policy.[58][59] The case was referred to arbitration in August 2020.[60] Under pressure, the company revised its policy.[61][62] The company settled a lawsuit with District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine for $2.5 million, with funds going to deliverers, the government, and to charity.[63][64][65]

Antitrust litigation[edit]
In April 2020, in the case of Davitashvili v. GrubHub Inc. DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates, and Uber Eats were accused of monopolistic power by only listing restaurants on their apps if the restaurant owners signed contracts which include clauses that require prices be the same for dine-in customers as for customers receiving delivery.[66][67][68][69] The plaintiffs stated that this arrangement increases the cost for dine-in customers, as they are required to subsidize the cost of delivery; and that the apps charge “exorbitant” fees, which range from 13% to 40% of revenue, while the average restaurant's profit ranges from 3% to 9% of revenue.[66][67][68][69] The lawsuit seeks treble damages, including for overcharges, since April 14, 2016 for dine-in and delivery customers in the United States at restaurants using the defendants’ delivery apps.[9][66][67][68][69] Although several preliminary documents in the case have now been filed, a trial date has not yet been set.[70]

Data security[edit]
On May 4, 2019, DoorDash confirmed 4.9 million customers, delivery workers and merchants had sensitive information stolen via a data breach. Those who joined the platform after April 5, 2018 were unaffected by the breach.[71]

Driver strike and tip transparency[edit]
In July 2021, DoorDash drivers went on strike to protest lack of tip transparency and to ask for higher pay. At the time of the strike, and as of March 2022, DoorDash did not allow drivers to see tip amounts prior to accepting a delivery in the app. The strike occurred after DoorDash rewrote its code to cut off access to Para, a third-party app that drivers had been using to see tip amounts.[72][7]

Lawsuit by the city of Chicago[edit]
In August 2021, the city of Chicago sued DoorDash and GrubHub. According to Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, the companies broke the law by using "unfair and deceptive tactics to take advantage of restaurants and consumers who were struggling to stay afloat [during the COVID-19 pandemic]."[73] DoorDash and GrubHub denied the suit's merits.[73]

2017 Class action lawsuit[edit]
In 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed against DoorDash for allegedly misclassifying delivery drivers in California and Massachusetts as independent contractors. In 2022, a tentative settlement was reached in which DoorDash would pay $100 million dollars total, with $61 million going to over 900,000 drivers, paying out just over $130 per driver, and $28 million for the lawyers.[74][8] Gizmodo criticized the settlement, noting that the $413 million that DoorDash CEO Tony Xu received the previous year was one of the largest CEO compensation packages of all time.[8]

Philanthropy[edit]
In 2018, DoorDash launched Project DASH, a partnership with local food security organizations to deliver donations to those in need.[75] By August 2019, the program had expanded to 25 cities in the United States and Canada and had delivered more than one million pounds of food.[76] As of September 2021, Project DASH operated in more than 900 cities and had delivered more than 15 million meals.[77][78]
DoorDash partnered with the National Urban League in 2020 as part of its Main Street Strong program, which included a pledge of $200 million over five years to support restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic. The partnership with the NUL includes $12 million in funding to assist drivers of color in building job skills and financial literacy.[79]

Frank points to a clause in the contracts restaurants and the food delivery apps agree to that prohibits owners from charging delivery customers more than people who dine in, even though delivery costs more. "By not forcing those purchasing on apps to bear the whole amount of the fees, instead forcing all menu prices to rise together, in-restaurant diners are effectively subsidizing Grubhub's high rates," said Frank, who argues such an arrangement is anti-competitive and illegal.

Each of the firms uses “monopoly power” to prevent competition, limit consumer choice and force restaurants to agree to illegal contracts that have “the purpose and effect of fixing prices,” the suit claimed. ... The four companies give restaurants a “devil’s choice” that requires them to keep dine-in prices the same as delivery prices if they want to be on the app-based delivery platforms, the suit claimed. And restaurants must pay commissions to the delivery firms ranging from 13.5% to 40%, the suit alleged.  ... Establishments are forced to “calibrate their prices to the more costly meals served through the delivery apps,” the suit alleged.

Retrieved May 19, 2020. GrubHub, DoorDash, Postmates and Uber Eats were sued on Monday for allegedly exploiting their dominance in restaurant meal deliveries to impose fees that consumers ultimately bear through higher menu prices, including during the coronavirus pandemic. In a proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court, three consumers said the defendants violated U.S. antitrust law by requiring that restaurants charge delivery customers and dine-in customers the same price, while imposing “exorbitant” fees of 10% to 40% of revenue to process delivery orders. The consumers, all from New York, said this sticks restaurants with a “devil’s choice” of charging everyone higher prices as a condition of using the defendants’ services.

The New York customers, who seek class-action status, say the delivery services charge “exorbitant fees” that range from 13% to 40% of revenue, while the average restaurant’s profit ranges from 3% to 9% of revenue, making delivery meals more expensive for eateries. “Restaurants could offer consumers lower prices for direct sales, because direct consumers are more profitable,” the plaintiffs said. “This is particularly true of dine-in consumers, who purchase drinks and additional items, tip staff, and generate good will.”
