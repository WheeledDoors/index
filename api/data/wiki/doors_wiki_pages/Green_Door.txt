Jim Lowe version[edit]
The song was first recorded by Jim Lowe, whose version reached number one on the US pop chart.  The lyrics describe the allure of a mysterious private club with a green door, behind which "a happy crowd" play piano, smoke and "laugh a lot", and inside which the singer is not allowed.  "Green Door" was backed by the orchestra of songwriter Davie, with Davie also playing piano, and by the vocal group the High Fives.  The track was arranged by Davie, who added thumbtacks to the hammers of his piano and sped up the tape to give a honky-tonk sound.[1]  Released by Dot Records, the single reached #1 on the Billboard charts for one week on November 17, 1956, replacing "Love Me Tender" by Elvis Presley.[2]  Outside the US, Lowe's version reached #8 on the charts, in the United Kingdom.[3]

Lyrics[edit]
The singer cannot get any sleep each evening, due to the sound of the music coming from the club, or possibly the singer is a G-man attempting to infiltrate the club. He tries to gain entry by knocking once on the green door, trying to tell the person behind the door that he had been there before, only to have the door slammed immediately ("hospitality's thin there"). Then, through the keyhole, he tries to say the possible secret password "Joe sent me" (the password for Hernando's Hideaway), which only results in laughter as he is again rejected admittance into the private club.

Possible inspirations[edit]
After the Great Chicago Fire, a tavern opened in Chicago, the Green Door Tavern.  During prohibition, this was a popular place to get secret libations.  As the door of the tavern is green, the color became a symbol of a speakeasy. During the Prohibition Era many restaurants would paint their doors green to indicate the presence of a speakeasy.[6]
One suggestion of the song's origins is that it was inspired by an afterhours club in Dallas, Texas, to which lyricist Moore had been refused entry because he did not know the correct password.[1]
At the time of the song's initial popularity in the 1950s, many believed it was inspired by a green-doored restaurant and bar called "The Shack" in Columbia, Missouri, where singer Jim Lowe had attended the University of Missouri. However long-time Shack owner Joe Franke doubts this theory.[7]
An oft-repeated urban legend has developed saying the song refers to London's first lesbian club, Gateways (1930–1985), which was in Bramerton Street in Chelsea. It had a green door and was featured in the film The Killing of Sister George.[8][9] But aside from that there is no substantive connection between the 1950s American song and the British club.[10]
In "The Green Door", a short story by O. Henry from his 1906 book The Four Million,[11] a man named Rudolf Steiner is handed a mysterious card reading, "The Green Door." On entering the door he meets a starving young woman. He quickly rushes out and returns laden with food, and they become friends over supper; finally Steiner promises to visit her again the next day and there is romance in the offing. Eventually it turns out that the card was an advertisement for an entirely different "Green Door", a theatre play. O. Henry uses the eponymous green door as a symbol for everyday adventures which he encourages us to seek out.
It is also possible that the song is a reference to an H. G. Wells short story, "The Door in the Wall."[12][13]
Behind the Green Door (1940)[14] is a Penny Parker mystery novel by Mildred Wirt Benson. In the novel, the secret door hides some illegal activity at a ski-resort hotel; no music or vice is involved in this book aimed at adolescent girls. It was reprinted in 1951, a few years before the song appeared.
Fitz-James O'Brien's short story, "The Lost Room", details a man being locked out of his own room by a group of demons and bears some similarity to the themes of the song.[15]

There are bars, taverns and saloons named "The Green Door" in many American locations, including Cheyenne, Wyoming, New York City, Park Hall, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois and Lansing, Michigan.
Within the American intelligence community, "green door" is a slang verb and adjective, relating to the restriction of an individual's or organization's access to information and/or locations: "We green doored them," or "The situation has been highlighted by the 'Green Door' compartmentation and exclusion".[43] This meaning was alluded to in episode 4 of Ashes to Ashes, set in 1981, when Shakin' Stevens' cover played whilst the protagonist police detectives sneaked out of a top-secret MOD research centre.
It was also featured in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, sung by Leonardo DiCaprio (playing the character of fictional actor Rick Dalton) during a segment on Hullaballoo.
The lyrics "Green door, what's that secret you're keepin'" get a full-page quote (with a smaller attribution text: "Marvin Moore - Lyrics to 'The Green Door'") in the first internal page of The Immortal Hulk #10, a comic book published by Marvel Comics.[44] In that issue (and other issues of the same comic book), a particular green door is an integral part of the story.
