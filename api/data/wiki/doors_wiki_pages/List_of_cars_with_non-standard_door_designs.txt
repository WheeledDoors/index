List of non-standard door designs[edit]
The main types of non-standard door designs are:

Butterfly –  butterfly doors move via hinges along the A-pillar, on an axis not aligned vertically or horizontally to the vehicle or ground. A special type of butterfly door is a single door at the front of the car with the steering wheel attached.
Canopy –  roof, windshield, and sides are one unit that moves upward, forward, or sideways to provide access.
Gullwing –  (also called "falcon-wing") hinged to the roof at the top horizontal edge of the door, and open upward on a horizontal axis. Gullwing doors with a second hinge between door and moving roof panel are called falcon wing doors.
Similar to a Gull Wing door the Falcon wing door is a double hinged rear door on the Tesla Model X. The primary hinge is located along the midline of the roof, the second hinge is above the side window. This configuration has the advantage of allowing unobstructed access to the rear seats whilst also enabling the doors to open in a tight space because the door can initially open upwards before spreading outwards with a gap as small as 8-inches to adjacent vehicles.

Scissors –  rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door, and open by rotating on a horizontal axis, perpendicular to the vehicle's length. Scissor doors that also move outward while rotating are called dihedral synchro-helix actuation doors.
Sliding –  mounted to or suspended from a track, and open by sliding horizontally alongside or into the vehicle sidewall, or open by sliding vertically into the vehicle sidewall or floor. Sliding doors that disappear into the floor horizontally are called rolling doors.
Suicide –  hinged on the rear end of the door-frame, and open horizontally towards the rear.
Swan  –  opens outward like either a conventional door or a suicide door, but on an axis slightly tilted from vertical, or via articulation in the hinge to angle upward for better ground clearance 
Some custom limousines have enlarged doors.
