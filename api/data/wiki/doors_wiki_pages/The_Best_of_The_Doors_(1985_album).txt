The Best of the Doors(1985)

The Doors (soundtrack)(1991)

The Best of The Doors is a compilation album by American rock group the Doors. Released in 1985, the double LP set contains 18 songs from their first six albums with lead singer Jim Morrison, including charting singles and selected album cuts.[1] Danny Sugerman contributed a short essay which discussed the band's origins, influences and Morrison's personality, and was printed inside the gatefold sleeve.
When the album was released on compact disc in 1991, it reached number 32 in the U.S. and in the top twenty in several other countries. In February 2007, the album was certified as Diamond 10× by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Critical reception[edit]
Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[2]
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Bruce Eder gave the album a rating of four and a half out of five stars. He commented that, when it was released in 1985, The Best of the Doors was the most comprehensive collection to date and provided a good overview.[2] However, he noted:

Good as it is, the compilation misleads somewhat by removing the material from its original context and also shuffling the order, so that songs off of The Soft Parade bump up against tracks from L.A. Woman. The hits can stand on their own, but overall the music lacks the broader impact that it was intended to have when heard juxtaposed with the other tracks on their respective original albums.[2]
Eder added that more recent albums, which also benefit from remastering, "renders this collection somewhat less attractive than it was on its initial release".[2]
