Two Doors Down is a Scottish television sitcom, produced by BBC Studios.[1] It was created by Simon Carlyle and Gregor Sharp, and stars Arabella Weir, Alex Norton, Doon Mackichan, Jonathan Watson and Elaine C. Smith as oft-warring neighbours of each other in a suburban street in Scotland.
Following a one-off Hogmanay special broadcast nationwide on BBC One in late 2013, a full series was commissioned,[2] and began airing on BBC Two in April 2016,[1] with a second that November.[3] A third series in 2018 (and a 2017 Christmas special)[4] and a fourth in 2019 followed. A fifth series was announced in mid-2020,[5] with filming delayed until the following year due to restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic;[6][7] to compensate, a Christmas special was filmed in late 2020 for broadcast that December. The fifth series began airing on 6 December 2021, and will resume in 2022, to be followed by a sixth series later in the year.[8] Two Doors Down won the Best Comedy award at the 2017 Royal Television Society Scotland Awards, with separate BAFTA Scotland wins for cast and crew over the course of its run.[9]

Premise[edit]
The series creator, Simon Carlyle, stated: "Two Doors Down is about crazy neighbours. We've all got them. They seem ok, but when you scratch the surface they're a bit nuts."[10] Two Doors Down focuses on neighbours living side by side in a typical Glasgow suburb. BBC Scotland describes the characters as "not so happily living together" – the neighbours are constantly visiting uninvited, and overstaying their welcome, at Beth and Eric Baird's house.[10] Beth is often taken advantage of by her neighbours, frequently having to make tea, pour drinks and prepare food, while the remaining characters chat in the living room. Eric and Beth therefore try and avoid their neighbours as much as possible so they can enjoy some peace and quiet in their own home.[10]

Ian and Jaz don't exactly make a good first impression on the neighbours, as a drunken Cathy causes trouble when she accompanies Beth to their flatwarming; an errant swingball, while waiting for the tennis coverage, gives a burglar-concerned Christine the chance to practice her baseball bat on Colin, and to a larger extent, Eric.
54Episode 4Simon HyndSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp22 April 2016 (2016-04-22)1.15
A quiet birthday is not one of the wishes granted for Eric, whose evening in alone is disturbed by Cathy and Colin - holding disparate attitudes on divulging their fertility test results - as well as Christine and Sophie - who display different levels of mourning for the relative whose funeral they've just been to - and Ian and Jaz - who have completely forgotten the special occasion. Birthday presents are gifted, and the topic of discussion unfortunately lets slip something embarrassing that's dragged down from the attic for all to see.

Christine is determined to find out who the father of Sophie's baby is, and as a last ditch attempt locks her in the back garden shed.

A sizeable PPI refund payout for Christine lands Beth with hosting duties for a neighbourly celebration barbecue, at which a bronzed Cathy proudly, and arrogantly, shows off her special Spanish ham, and she and Colin try to get one of the others to accompany them on their next cruise - in search of a recommendation discount.

A distant car alarm wakes the neighbourhood up, with Christine and Colin misinterpreting a remark by Eric as an invitation into the Bairds'. Soon enough, a midnight feast ensues and Sophie and Cathy arrive, reigniting a feud between Christine and Sophie over what to name the baby - but some reminiscing and a search through the television leading to the shipping forecast quells all.
103Episode 3Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp5 December 2016 (2016-12-05)1.69
A Sunday roast at Beth's gets derailed, with Cathy incensed at Colin but not willing to discuss why, Jaz getting wound up - from Colin and by himself - over his return to work from sick leave the next day, and his requiring of a vegetarian alternative seeing Ian go out to buy one and Christine and Sophie tagging along upon his return.

Cathy reluctantly plays hostess as everyone comes to celebrate Colin's dad, Willie's, birthday. Beth progressively gets handed the reins to organise everything, Willie can't crack a smile, and Ian and Jaz are on tenterhooks waiting to see if their offer on a flat has come good. Everyone's spirits soon pick up, however, when Willie's old accordion makes an appearance...

Christine's computer troubles (she is technophobic) end up burdening Beth further, already dealing with the clutter from Ian and Jaz's temporary stay before they can move in to their new flat. Christine soon ropes everyone in to searching for anywhere that has the Barneyboo buggy in stock - insisting it must be in blue to match the umbrella Pat over the back has bought as a matching set - while Eric mulls over wearing a kilt or not for a Scotland away game in Latvia.

The Bairds' baby shower for Sophie takes a sour turn when Christine isn't exactly impressed with what's on offer, and Cathy and Colin revel in winding up an already-anxious Jaz (dismissing a black eye as a packing incident) about the notorious location of his and Ian's new flat... although Sophie gets her revenge. Final appearance of Sophie and Jaz.

Beth and Eric's turkey crown ends up in smaller portions than expected when Christmas dinner for two ends up being for six; with flights from France grounded, Sophie is stranded in the airport unable to celebrate her first Christmas with her baby, Madison, and Cathy and Colin's plans to go skiing are off. Ian pays his parents a visit, with his new Yorkshire-born boyfriend Gordon in tow, who attracts Cathy's attention straight away and is accidentally outed by Christine to his parents. A ramshackle Christmas becomes special, nevertheless, as Cathy discovers her celestial gift and Eric gets his old Santa suit down from the attic. First appearance of Gordon.
151"Burns Supper"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp29 January 2018 (2018-01-29)2.11
Everyone is celebrating Burns' Night, but the renovations done to the Bairds' downstairs toilet end up being the temporary focus of attention instead. Scotland-adopted Gordon gets into the spirit of things, wearing tartan and starting a sing-song, Eric's enthusiasm for the occasion is diluted by Beth's apathy, Christine is very keen to tell everyone about her daughter's new living situation - and how dismayed she is at where it is - and a discussion about past commemorations ends up with Cathy massively overreacting when she gets it into her head that Colin and his ex-girlfriend are speaking to each other behind her back.
162"Eric's Colon"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp5 February 2018 (2018-02-05)1.50
An accident during a colonoscopy has resulted in Eric needing to recuperate on the downstairs couch, and soon his suffering becomes a spectacle. Cathy and Colin pop in on their way to dinner with a couple whose wife's occupation remains nameless, and Christine works out a solution to Beth's inability to take her to the supermarket, roping Ian into it. Her shopping quickly becomes the products of Beth's cooking as everyone pressures her into making homemade soup, and Gordon's appearance with some crusty bread too leads up to Eric attending to the toilet... and the sounds of his activity prove a must-listen.
173"Break In"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp12 February 2018 (2018-02-12)1.69
Cathy becomes distraught when she discovers that, upon the discovery her and Colin's house having been ransacked by burglars while they were away on holiday, someone has relieved themselves in her pants' drawer. Beth is assigned the role of washing all of Cathy's clothes as a precaution (as everyone else inspects her lingerie for any evidence of titillation), and then seamstress as Gordon's new trousers for a wedding he and Ian are going to need taken up... and the sight of his bare legs appears to take the edge of the day's events for Cathy.
184"Fish Friday"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp19 February 2018 (2018-02-19)1.63
A belated birthday treat for Beth to a local pub for dinner gets two unexpected guests added to the roster, with Christine near enough inviting herself, and Colin, deciding to spend his free time while Cathy is away at a spa getting drunk, bothering the assembled company with his lechery.
195"Party Pieces"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp26 February 2018 (2018-02-26)1.72
Arriving home from a mixed performance at the pub quiz, Beth surprises everyone with revelations about her past career aspirations. They are not long after interrupted by Christine, who is after a lift up the hospital to see Pat after her dog attacked her, and Ian and Gordon, returning home early from a weekend in Amsterdam after the former's activities in a gay bar toilet. The gathering soon turns into a party as Beth is relegated to frying up some homemade chips and all are eager to show off their party tricks, from magic, impressions, tongue-twisters, mournful meows, and doing the crab - with Gordon's hedge-hurdling going quite wrong...
206"Alan and Michelle"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp5 March 2018 (2018-03-05)1.81
Christine palms off organising a welcoming party for the new, rather mismatched, couple across the street, Alan and Michelle, onto Beth. There being a younger woman on the street raises Cathy's jealousy levels, which soon boil over and she takes to seeing to the house porch Michelle has condemned...

An anniversary party for Eric and Beth goes awry, with Cathy insisting on answers to her questions on whether Ian and Gordon and Alan and Michelle would ever marry each other, Christine insisting someone at least try her trifle - and the parlour games not doing much to rescue the occasion, with the addition of Michelle wanting to wear Beth's wedding dress, Cathy and Colin re-enacting their first dance, and Gordon feeling spurned - after Ian's unwillingness to marry him - to the mix.
222"Willie's Wake"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp14 January 2019 (2019-01-14)1.63
Cathy persistently tries to turn the solemn occasion of Colin's dad's wake into a less mournful one - with the help of some alcohol, as well as reluctant, happenchance invites Alan, Michelle and Gordon. Christine is frustrated about the non-religiosity of the affair, and is not afraid of voicing her complaints or trying to get everyone else to reminisce over Seve Ballesteros.
233"Hospital"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp21 January 2019 (2019-01-21)1.64
A routine operation turns into an overnight stay in hospital for Christine, and a populated visiting time raises a medley of discussions that all lead to Christine worrying about whether she'll survive her surgery - and Eric wondering if he'll ever get his dinner.
244"Graham & Sandra"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp28 January 2019 (2019-01-28)N/A (<1.63)[a]

255"Overnight"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp4 February 2019 (2019-02-04)1.63
Beth's invitation to Alan and Michelle to stay the night while their home is covered in sawdust proves more trouble than it's worth, when Alan, to Michelle's chagrin, takes advantage of the hospitality, and Cathy takes umbrage at Beth and Michelle getting close and becomes desperate to outdo her in the non-existent friendship stakes. Meanwhile, Christine's obsession with the cat-urine-stained rhubarb her neighbour found round the back of her shed leads to a late-night snack for everyone... and causes a row and a sight not to behold.
266"Housewarming"Sasha RansomeSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp11 February 2019 (2019-02-11)1.74
Michelle is perseverant in trying to impress all at her housewarming party, although Alan not taking the situation seriously - including neglecting the serving of drinks and spreading private news about his sex life to Eric and Colin - as well as snide remarks from a jealous Cathy don't help, especially when Michelle's attention is redirected to the sudden arrival of a long-time friend, whose deafness provides a talking point for the neighbours and an opportunity to get away with mocking a frenziedly-envious Cathy as well as Christine's deliberate sympathy push, as she overexaggerates the state of an eye injury.

Cathy and Colin's plans to spend the festive season in Dubai have been put paid to by COVID-19, and hole up in a cabin in the Highlands. Joined by Beth, Eric, Christine, Ian and Gordon for a post-Christmas jolly-up, the initial fun - buoyed by exciting relationship news from Ian and Gordon and light banter about everyone's activities during lockdown and the amount of repeats on TV - almost immediately begins to subside as Cathy manipulates everyone into staying in rather than venturing outside, and her hospitality sharply extinguishes when Gordon mocks her via impression and Beth lambasts her for her drinking... with an unbothered Christine continuing her reminiscing, Colin stuck between supporting his wife and finally revealing what he really thinks about her behaviour, and an atmosphere so sour no-one wants to be there.
Series 5 (2021–22)[edit]
Plans for a fifth series were formally announced in mid-2020,[5] with filming originally set to start at that time delayed until March 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.[6][7][13][14]
Filming was subsequently interrupted by Joy McAvoy giving birth, and as a result was only completed on two episodes and the Christmas special.[15] Filming resumed in February 2022.[16]

Beth's cooking up a veggie curry as part of a quiet family dinner to celebrate Ian and Gordon's second anniversary. It isn't long before the neighbours drop round, though; Christine rather unwilling to eat anything prepared in the Bairds' kitchen - believing her bout of diarrhoea comes from a dodgy ham sandwich she ate there - and Cathy and Colin in search of a free meal and getting rather annoyed at Gordon when the lack of meat in their meal becomes apparent - on top of the revelation coming from Ian's black eye that he didn't step into help when he was attacked.

Beth's got a bad cold and has taken to her bed, but she and Eric aren't escaping everyone else pestering them and advising on how best to nurse her back to health, with Christine persistently claiming the benefits of the homemade soup she's brought round, Colin and Cathy thinking that alcohol is the way forward, and Ian trying his best to defend his father as the discussion moves onto critiquing how well he's looking after her.
303"Christmas Special"Ben Gosling FullerSimon Carlyle & Gregor Sharp20 December 2021 (2021-12-20)2.00
Michelle and Alan host a pre-Christmas neighbourly get-together, where her efforts go somewhat unappreciated with Cathy not afraid to show her displeasure at what's been arranged for them all, Colin determined to snatch her under the mistletoe he's brought, and Christine overdoes the guilt trip with Beth after learning she and Eric are considering spending the festive season in Yorkshire with Gordon and his parents. Alan is predictably less-than-excited about the whole affair, and heads out back for a sneaky toke... soon joined by Ian and Gordon and leading to some rather inappropriate under-the-influence behaviour...
Production[edit]
The pilot episode was shot with all the crew and cast in a "cramped, medium-sized living room".[1] After the pilot was deemed successful, filming was moved to purpose-built sets in Dumbarton.[1] Filming for the first series took place in the late summer and autumn of 2015.[17][18]
Exterior scenes were filmed in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire; these were moved to Avonbrae Crescent, Hamilton from series 4.[19]
Location filming for series 2 included Prestwick Airport and a local supermarket.[20]
For the 2020 Christmas special, COVID-19 restrictions prompted changes to production, such as the entire cast and certain members of the crew isolating for two days prior to filming and doing so throughout the five-day shoot.[21][22]

Critical reception[edit]
Two Doors Down's initially mixed reception has grown more positive over the course of the show.
Writing for The Guardian, Ben Arnold said the first episode of the series was "a mundane set-up, not helped by a woeful lack of laughs,"[23] sentiments he repeated upon reviewing the start of the second series.[24] The Arts Desk wrote that the series "owes an awful lot to both Abigail’s Party and The Royle Family, as well as socially awkward characters from any number of sketch shows, with equally broadly defined characters – only without the bits that make you laugh out loud."[25] Writing for RadioTimes, David Butcher said "Sometimes Two Doors Down is so uneventful it almost vanishes" but called it a "nicely sour-edged sitcom".[26] Conversely, The Guardian's Zoe Williams said, at the time of the first series, "this endearing ensemble BBC Comedy about a sort of Scottish neighbours has something-for-everyone humour,"[27] with The Observer's Euan Ferguson writing, of the second series, that "[it] has it all. Wit, delight, long awkward silences, burps, bacon-farts."[28]
A review of the series 3 opener by the i's Sarah Hughes noticed the "nice, dry one liners (most of them delivered by the estimable Elaine C Smith) and an expert ensemble cast, who manage to make you if not quite laugh out loud then at least gently smile in recognition,"[29] shared by Chris Harvey of The Telegraph in his review, opining "Not all of the material was funny, but the acting carried it."[30] With regards to series 4, The Herald's Alison Rowat commented that "the jokes ... are easier to see coming than before, but by this stage in the game the comedy is coming more from the characters than the situation".[31]
Critical reaction to the 2020 special was overwhelmingly positive, with The Telegraph's Anita Singh calling it "one of the unsung gems of the festive season", saying it "takes a well-worn scenario ... and gives it some bite",[32] and The Guardian's Rebecca Nicholson lauding praise on the cast, while noting that "for those of us missing family gatherings this year, this is an accurate re-enactment of some of its most awkward corners".[33]
The series 5 opener received mixed reviews. Benji Wilson from The Telegraph, in a two-star review, claimed "[t]he storylines are so formulaic you're left wondering if this or that plot has already happened in the same episode, let alone in some other sitcom," but opined "[w]hat saves [the show] from the realms of utter dreck is the performances, which are the definition of making the best of a bad situation".[34] The i's Ed Power awarded four stars, admitting the episode "coasted along on a script that was gently droll rather than madly hilarious" yet "care was taken not to look down on the characters or suggest suburban life was some sort of beige hell,"[35] while, in a three-star review, The Times's Carol Midgley considered it "wasn't the funniest episode [she had] seen, but the writing is always tight and sharp" with "spot-on observations about the banal truths of normal life" and singled out Doon Mackichan and Elaine C. Smith as "consistently the funniest performers".[36] The Christmas special's reviews skewed positive; The Telegraph's three-star review from Michael Hogan said that while "[the show] won't win any awards for originality", the episode was "a wryly witty treat which captured the claustrophobic domesticity of Christmas" with "its endearing warmth and estimable ensemble cast",[37] with a four-star review from Radio Times's Huw Fullerton observing that "[t]he joy of Two Doors Down is that you can more or less predict what comes next [...] but the way the familiar beats develop is still laugh-out-loud funny, believable and even (in certain moments) a little bit festive," concluding it was "simple but well-observed character comedy".[38]
