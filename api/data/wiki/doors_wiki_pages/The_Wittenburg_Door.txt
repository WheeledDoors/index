 "Thesentür" (door of the theses) memorial at Schlosskirche in Lutherstadt Wittenberg
The Wittenburg Door, sometimes known as simply The Door, was a Christian satire and humor magazine, previously published bimonthly by the non-profit Trinity Foundation based in Dallas, Texas.[1] The magazine started publication in 1971[2] and ceased publication in 2008.[3] It was then published only online by John Bloom[citation needed] until its recent transition to a new group of "door keepers".[citation needed] The title was a reference to the Ninety-Five Theses written by Martin Luther in 1517 that he is believed to have posted on the door of the All Saints' Church, Wittenberg.[4] A documentary, Nailin' it to the Church, by Murray Stiller was made in 2009.[citation needed]
