Synopsis[edit]
Céleste (Monique Spaziani), a jazz pianist, has reached the twilight of her years. Alone in her New York apartment, she looks back on her life and decides to record it all in a diary that she sends to her estranged son, Blaudelle (Gabriel Arcand). The arrival of the diary disrupts Blaudelle's life, although his son, Antoine (François Méthé), is intrigued, and it is through his eyes that Céleste's life is revealed.
