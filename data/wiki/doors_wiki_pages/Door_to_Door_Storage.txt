Door To Door Storage was a self-storage company which provided a self-storage box service for customers to fill at their premises. It was acquired in May 2017 by U-Haul.[1] The company delivers the storage boxes which customers load and then ships the boxes to their storage facilities.[2]
Door To Door Storage was founded in Kent, Washington, in May 1996 by Tim Riley,[3] a first-time entrepreneur who had previously worked for Shurgard Storage Centers. The company has locations in metropolitan areas all across the U.S., from Washington to Florida and California to New Hampshire.
The containers are 7 feet (2.1 m) tall and measure 5 by 8 feet (1.5 m × 2.4 m).[4]  Each will typically accommodate one to one-and-one-half rooms of household goods. They stand about 4 inches (100 mm) above the ground and are made of pressure-treated 3/4" plywood with a weather-resistant cover.[citation needed]
