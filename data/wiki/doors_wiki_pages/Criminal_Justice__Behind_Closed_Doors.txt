Development[edit]
On 12 February 2020, Sameer Nair, CEO of Aditya Birla Group's content studio Applause Entertainment and BBC Studios India, announced for the sequel of Criminal Justice, which will be adapted from the second season of the 2008 British original series.[2] Sameer Gogate, business head of production at BBC Studios India said "The success of season one has shown what good content can achieve, and we hope the second season will be equally loved by the audiences."[2] While Pankaj Tripathi, Anupriya Goenka and Mita Vashisht were reported to reprise their roles from the first season, the makers did not reveal about the new cast and crew, including the director.[3]
In April 2020, the makers announced that Kirti Kulhari will appear in the new season, with Apurva Asrani roped in as the screen writer and Rohan Sippy and Arjun Mukherjee were roped in to helm the series.[citation needed] On 3 December 2020, the makers announced the new title as Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors.[4]

Filming[edit]
Principal shooting of the series took place on March 2020, but was immediately stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India.[5] The shoot was resumed in July 2020, with the makers following the safety guidelines imposed by the government in order to curb COVID-19 spread. The entire season is shot at three locations spanning over 60-70 working days.[1][6] Shooting of the series was completed on September 2020.[5]

Release[edit]
The series was initially scheduled for a release on November 2020, before being postponed to December.[6] On 8 December 2020, the makers unveiled character posters of the series,[7] with the trailer being unveiled on 10 December 2020.[8][9] The series released on Disney+ Hotstar on 24 December 2020 in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali and Marathi languages.[citation needed]

Reception[edit]
Ektaa Malik, writing for The Indian Express gave three out of five and said, "Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors is a gripping morality tale, that is not to be missed".[10] Divyanshi Sharma of India Today, gave three-and-a-half out of five and stated, "Criminal Justice is an important show, if not the most perfect one. And with every episode ending at a point where you want to know what happens next, it comes across as a successful thriller. The show ends on a bittersweet note, reminding us that no matter how much it rains, the sun will always shine."[11] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave three-and-a-half out of five and said, "As a legal drama, Criminal Justice S2 is pretty close to being top-notch. But it is its sharp-eyed exploration of women seeking equality in life and at work that elevates the series to a higher plane".[12] Tatsam Mukherjee from Firstpost stated "Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors flirts with the notorious brand of 'realistic' that traverses the line of exploitative and vulgar."[13] Nandini Ramnath from Scroll.in wrote " Kirti Kulhari’s heartrending performance is especially laudable considering her frustrating passiveness for the part. By reserving Anu’s transformation until the very end, the series reveals how hard it is for women to publicly admit to violence."[14]
