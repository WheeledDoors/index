Swan doors are a type of door sometimes seen on high performance cars or concept cars. Swan doors operate in a similar way to conventional car doors but unlike regular doors, they open at an upward angle.[1] This design helps the doors to clear curbs, especially on lower sports cars, by opening slightly upward and away from the curb.[2] The name comes from a car's resemblance with its doors open to a swan with its wings open. 
Aston Martin have used the design on many of their models, including the DB9, DB10, DB11, DBS V12, One-77, Rapide, Vantage, Vanquish, Virage, CC100 and the Vulcan.[3] The design was also used by Aston Martin's sister company, Lagonda, on the Lagonda Taraf, as well as by other manufacturers on the Hennessey Venom GT, Vencer Sarthe and Pagani Huayra Roadster.[4] Concept cars have used Swan doors as well, including the Jaguar C-X75 concept, Nissan URGE, Bertone Nuccio, Lamborghini Asterion, Toyota NS4 and more.
