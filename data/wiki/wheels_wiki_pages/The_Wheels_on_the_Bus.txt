"The Wheels on the Bus"SongLanguageEnglishPublishedDecember 1937GenreChildren'sfolkSongwriter(s)Verna Hills
"The Wheels on the Bus" is an American folk song written by Verna Hills (1898–1990).[1] The earliest known publishing of the lyrics is the December 1937 issue of American Childhood,[2] originally called "The Bus", with the lyrics being "The wheels of the bus", with each verse ending in lines relevant to what the verse spoke of, as opposed to the current standard "all through the town" (or "all day long" in some versions).
It is a popular children's song in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Italy, and Denmark, and is often sung by children on bus trips to keep themselves amused.[citation needed] It has a repetitive rhythm, making the song easy for many people to sing, in a manner similar to the song "99 Bottles of Beer". It is based on the traditional British song "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush". The song is also sometimes sung to the tune of "Buffalo Gals", as in the version done by Raffi.

Normally followed by "The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish" (with action), "the horn on the bus goes beep beep beep", and "the people on the bus go up and down" (with action). Some versions substitute "bounce up and down" for "go up and down", and some modern commercial recordings of the song in children's toys simplify the tune by copying notes 7 through 9 onto notes 13 through 15.[clarification needed]

Lyrics as they were originally found in the December 1937 issue of American Childhood:
1. The wheels of the bus go round and round,
Round and round, round and round;
The wheels of the bus go round and round,
Over the city streets.

2. The horn of the bus goes "Too-to-too,
"Too-to-too, too-to-too,"
the horn of the bus goes "Too-to-too"
At the other busses it meets.

3. The people in the bus go up and down,
Up and down,
up and down;
The people in the bus go up and down,
Bouncing off their seats.

Note that this version does not make any reference to the melody that is commonly attached to the song.
