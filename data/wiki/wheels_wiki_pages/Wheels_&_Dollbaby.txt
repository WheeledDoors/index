Wheels & Dollbaby is a fashion label based in Australia, founded by Melanie Greensmith and then husband Brett Ford, a drummer who had played with many 1980s Perth and Sydney 'grunge' music acts such as Lubricated Goat, Stu Spasm, and Tex Perkins.
Greensmith later ran the label with her partner, Divinyls guitarist Mark McEntee.
Wheels & Dollbaby first opened in 1987 in Hay Street, Perth before relocating to Crown Street in Darlinghurst, Sydney. In 2008, the brand opened a boutique in Perth.[1]
Clothes from the label were purchased for Sarah Michelle Gellar to wear on the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, after Greensmith managed to convince two Los Angeles boutiques, Lisa Kline and Fred Segal, to stock her line of clothing.[2]
Wheels & Dollbaby has been worn by celebrities including supermodels Jerry Hall and Kate Moss, singer Katy Perry, actor Scarlett Johansson and Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry. She has also collaborated with Burlesque icon Dita Von Teese to create the Dita Cardigan.[3]
In October 2017, Greensmith announced she was closing the business after thirty years, saying it was time to move on, but that she did not want to sell the company or the brand.[3] Greensmith relaunched the brand and the business in 2020.[4]
