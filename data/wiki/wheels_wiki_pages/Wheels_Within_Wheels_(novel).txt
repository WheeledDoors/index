Plot summary[edit]
Wheels Within Wheels is a novel which takes place in the La Nague Federation, a minimalist interstellar society.[1]

Reception[edit]
Greg Costikyan reviewed Wheels Within Wheels in Ares Magazine #2 and commented that "the author's politics do not dominate the novel – non-libertarians can safely read it without danger to their mental equilibrium."[1]
Kirkus Reviews states "A so-so effort, loosely linked to Wilson's Healer (1976); future volumes will apparently pull together the disparate threads."[2]
The novel won the Prometheus Award.[3]
