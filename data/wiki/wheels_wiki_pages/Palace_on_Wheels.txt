History[edit]
The Palace on Wheels started on 26 January 1982.[3]
The concept of the Palace on Wheels was derived from the royal background of the coaches, which were originally meant to be the personal railway coaches of the erstwhile rulers of the princely states of Rajputana, Baroda, the Nizam of Hyderabad and mainly  the Viceroy of British India.[4][5]

Interiors[edit]
Each saloon highlights the cultural ethos of the state, represented through the use of furniture, handicrafts, painting and furnishings.
Jaipur-based Architect Rashmi Gupta did the interiors of the train.[6]

Facilities[edit]
There are 23 coaches in the train. 104 tourists can travel in train. Each coach is named after former Rajput states and matches the aesthetics and interiors of the royal past: Alwar, Bharatpur, Bikaner, Bundi, Dholpur, Dungargarh, Jaisalmer, Jaipur, Jhalawar, Jodhpur, Kishangarh, Kota, Sirohi and Udaipur.[7] Each coach has four cabins (named chambers or saloons by the company) with luxury amenities and Wi-Fi internet.[8][9]
The train has two restaurants, The Mahārāja and The Mahārāni, with a Rajasthani ambience serving continental, Chinese cuisine, one bar-cum-lounge, 14 saloons and a spa.[9]
