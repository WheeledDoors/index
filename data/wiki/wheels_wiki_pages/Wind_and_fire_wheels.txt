 A matched set of two wind-and-fire wheels Wind-and-fire wheels (simplified Chinese: 风火轮; traditional Chinese: 風火輪; pinyin: feng huo lun) are melee weapons, wielded as a pair, associated with Chinese martial arts such as baguazhang and taijiquan.[1] Visually, they are similar to chakrams, although unlike chakrams they are not throwing weapons.
Each wheel is a flat metal ring approximately 38 cm (about 15 inches) in diameter. One quarter-segment has a padded grip with a cross-guard; the other three segments have protruding flame-styled blades. With one wheel in each hand, the practitioner can slash, stab, parry, or disarm an opponent.[2]
In the mythological story Fengshen Yanyi, the Immortal Taiyi gave Nezha a wind-wheel and a fire-wheel. These were stood on whilst chanting incantations, to serve as a magic vehicle.[3]
