Hot Wheels: AcceleRacers is a 2005 computer-animated series of four films produced by Canadian company Mainframe Entertainment, which also produced the television series ReBoot.[1] Available on DVD and VHS, it has also been shown on Cartoon Network.
A sequel to the 2003 miniseries Hot Wheels: World Race, the series takes place two years after the World Race in California and puts Mattel's Hot Wheels toy cars in a ReBoot-like situation, with racing somewhat reminiscent of Mario Kart. The films were distributed by Warner Bros. Television and the soundtrack was distributed by Sony BMG. A collectible card game, which was shown in the DVD bonus, and other merchandise were also made.
Four specials were aired on Cartoon Network in 2005: Ignition (January 8), The Speed of Silence (March 19), Breaking Point (June 25) and The Ultimate Race (October 1).[2]

Plot[edit]
Scientist Dr. Peter Tezla discovers that the Wheel of Power, an artifact from a highly advanced ancient civilization called the Accelerons, is a gateway to places called the Racing Realms. Tezla recruits two street racing teams, The Teku and The Metal Maniacs, to go into the Realms. The two teams race through the Realms, competing against evil robots called the Racing Drones and against mysterious human adversaries called the Silencerz. The winner of each Realm wins an AcceleCharger, a device that provides a power-up for a car with the power-up being based on a skill that is relevant to that Realm. The Teku and Metal Maniacs must ultimately team up to defeat the Drones, and secrets are revealed throughout the series about some characters' connections to the Silencerz.
