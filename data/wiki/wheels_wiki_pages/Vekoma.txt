History[edit]
The company originally manufactured farm equipment and later made steel constructions for the coal mining industry in the 1950s.[1] As business shifted from farming equipment to steel construction, Veld Koning Machinefabriek was shortened to Vekoma. After the closure of Dutch mines in 1965, Vekoma manufactured steel pipes for the petrochemical industry.[2] In the 1970s Vekoma was contracted by U.S. amusement ride manufacturer Arrow Development to build the steel structure for its roller coasters in Europe. As demand increased, Arrow instructed Vekoma in track building techniques and eventually licensed its coaster-building technology. In 1979 Vekoma entered the market on its own, opening three coasters in Europe under the name Vekoma Rides Manufacturing BV.[2]
In 2006, Vekoma formed an alliance with U.S.-based manufacturer Chance Morgan.[3] Chance Rides represented Vekoma in North America and Chance Morgan manufactured the steel track for select projects. During this agreement, Chance built four Vekoma-designed family coasters.[4]
In 2008, Vekoma Rides Manufacturing acquired the Wheels of Excellence range of Ferris wheels from Ronald Bussink. Under the agreement, Bussink will continue to supply wheels 100 meters and taller. Smaller wheels in the 40- to 80-meter range will be manufactured by a new division of Vekoma, Dutch Wheels BV.[5]
On October 17, 2012, Chance Rides and Vekoma discontinued the agreement to produce rides together for the North American market.[6] However, shortly after terminating that agreement, Chance Rides was given an exclusive license from Dutch Wheels BV to manufacture and sell R60 wheels in the North American market under a new affiliate, Chance American Wheels.[7]
On March 30, 2018, Vekoma was acquired by Sansei Technologies, the parent company of American ride manufacturer S&S Sansei. The conditions stipulated that Vekoma's business model remain unchanged after the acquisition. Vekoma continues to manufacture and market rides as a separate entity.[8]

Roller coasters[edit]
