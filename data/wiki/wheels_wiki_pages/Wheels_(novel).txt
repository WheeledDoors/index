 First edition (publ. Doubleday)
Wheels (1971) is a novel by Arthur Hailey, concerning the automobile industry and the day-to-day pressures involved in its operation.[1]
The plot lines follow many of the topical issues of the day, including race relations, corporate politics, and business ethics.  The auto company of the novel is a little-disguised Ford Motor Company and some of the characters are recognizable to company insiders.[citation needed]
