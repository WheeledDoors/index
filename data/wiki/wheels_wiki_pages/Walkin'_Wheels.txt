Overview and construction[edit]
 A boxer using one of the dog wheelchairs.
As the first adjustable dog wheelchair in the market,[4][obsolete source] Walkin' Wheels is designed to help pets with mobility problems like degenerative myelopathy, arthritis, paralysis, neurological disorders and more.
The construction is compromised of neoprene or fabric harness, which is clipped to an aluminum frame. The frame is attached to wheels that replace the function of the rear legs, allowing the dog increased mobility. The wheels are interchangeable, so the dog wheelchair can be used on dogs of different sizes, or dogs that are in the process of growing. Walkin' Wheels wheelchairs are available in four sizes: Mini, Small, Medium, and Large, with frames that will support dogs ranging in weight from 2-180 lbs. A knuckle mechanism both allows the angle of the wheel to be changed based on the health of the animal,[1] and allows the dog wheelchair to fold flat for easy transportation.[5] The rear Walkin' Wheels wheelchair can be converted into a full support, 4-wheel wheelchair with the Front Wheel Attachment.

Awards[edit]
2009, Award for Best Innovation in the category of animal health and integration of pets in society at the Mascota Pet Festival & Expo in Spain.[6][obsolete source]
2009, The silver Retailer Select Award from Pet Age magazine.[7][8]
