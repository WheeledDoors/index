Gameplay[edit]
Hot Wheels Unleashed is a racing game played from a third-person perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of vehicles from the Hot Wheels franchise, and raced against other opponents in miniature tracks set in various everyday locations and environments such garage, kitchen and bedroom. The vehicles featured in the game can be extensively customized. 66 different cars would be available at launch.[2] The game also features a career mode, a time trial, and a track editor.[3][4] The game supports up to 12 players in an online session, though players can also compete with another player in a local split-screen multiplayer mode.[2]

Development[edit]
The game was developed by Italian developer Milestone, the company behind the MotoGP games and the Ride series, and marks the first console game based around the property since 2013 [5][6] Milestone pitched the idea to Mattel in 2018 although they didn't expect them to take up the offer.[7] Milestone desired to create such a game after realizing that although they specialized in sim racers that was a "niche of the niche" and the racing genre itself was quite crowded with lead game designer, Federico Cardini telling Polygon "could me make a game to the level of, I don’t know, Gran Turismo? Technically speaking, yes. Should we go head to head with Gran Turismo? That does not sound like a great idea."[6] The game uses a physics system similar from Milestone's other games, heavily modified so that the cars would be able to perform stunts the series is known for. The team wanted to base the gameplay on physics because they felt that many other Arcade racers felt "scripted" with the cars not reacting to the player's action.[6]
According to Cardini, the lead game designer of Hot Wheels Unleashed, the development team desired to accurately replicate Hot Wheels vehicles to a "1:1 ratio" in the game. Using this method, the team added in many subtle details to the cars and maps.[5] Cardini described the in-game garage as the "inspiration to the entire game", noting its many characteristics.[5]

Marketing and release[edit]
The game was officially announced on February 25, 2021.[8] The game released on September 30, 2021 for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S.[9] Milestone also had plans to support the game extensively with downloadable content upon launch.[10]
